## Research Projects:
### Software Defined Wireless Sensor Network System                 12/2017-03/2018
__Project Description:__ Software defined networking (SDN) makes implementations of many techniques (e.g., artificial intelligence, or AI) easy, and in turn these techniques greatly improve the performance and resilience of SDN. Unfortunately, SDN systems have not yet been implemented in actual wireless sensor networks (WSNs), only in simulators.    
In this project, we present Malak, the first practical SDN implementation for WSNs, which achieves intelligence, high performance and resilience simultaneously. We use a set of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to serve as Malak’s SDN controllers. In Malak, sensor nodes communicate through UAVs within one-hop communication ranges, and they communicate in a traditional multi-hop manner when UAVs are not around. This new routing protocol greatly improves the throughput of a WSN and sensor nodes’ energy efficiency. Malak includes easy-to-use SDN interfaces, and we have implemented five SDN applications, namely routing, multitask, network diagnosis, AI energy exhaustion prediction, and AI node selection.    
This work has been submitted to the Mobicom 2018 for review.

### UAV-Enabled Sensor System                                       08/2017-11/2017
__Project Description:__ Sensor networks have been widely studied, but implementing a real system that achieves resilience, high performance and energy efficiency simultaneously is still a challenging task. We present Adler, a real unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled sensor system that can meet that challenge for general applications. We demonstrate Adler in three fundamental applications: localization, gathering and network reconfiguration. Evaluation results validate Adler’s ability to achieve resilience, high performance and energy efficiency. Using Adler’s application program interfaces (APIs), it is easy to evaluate algorithms for a pure sensor system or a UAV-enabled sensor system. More importantly, Adler has the potential to realize global optimization in a distributed sensor system, which is a promising feature for a software-defined sensor network or a large-scale Internet-of-Things (IoT) network.

UAV to locate, track and land on a moving vehicle automatically ([Champion](https://gbtimes.com/chinese-win-drone-challenge-inaugural-robotics-competition))    
__Project Description:__ The challenge requirement is that the target vehicle is traveling at a speed of 15km / h, the UAV needs to automatically take off, and locate landing marker on the moving vehicle, then track and land at target location on the moving vehicle. We completed software design based on the Robot operating system(ROS) running on Airborne processor, and the project is divided into three parts, including vision detection, tacking control and landing control. the vision system detecting the landing mark on the moving vehicle, proportional guidance with impact angle constraints algorithm is used for tacking control, so we can ensure that the aircraft lands quickly and steadily on the moving vehicle.   
__Duty Description:__ UAV tacking control, landing control and software integration.

__Project Description:__ The drone is controlled by an adaptive control algorithm to improve stability and immunity of the system (this part is the angle closed-loop attitude control to achieve), and further, through the altitude controller to achieve altitude closed-loop, utilize the positioning controller to achieve the location closed loop, and then the drone can take off and landing automatically.   
The work is based on STM32F4 hardware platform, and using MPU9250 as IMU, Through the Inertial navigation algorithm to obtain the attitude, adaptive control algorithm to control quadrotor.
