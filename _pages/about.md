Hello! I'm Dongda Li — or 李东达, as written in Chinese. Friends and colleagues often refer to me affectionately as Dongdong. My academic pursuits are rooted in the field of machine learning, with a specific focus on reinforcement learning.

My research is driven by the desire to refine machine learning algorithms for broad, practical applications. Lately, my work has centered on Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), an area brimming with possibilities for enhancing efficiency in sectors like warehouse management and logistics.
