My name is Dongda Li, (‘李东达’ in Chinese), people sometimes call me Dongdong, I'm doing research on machine learning, specifically, reinforcement learning. 

My general research interest is making the machine learning algorithms usefully for more general and practical applications. Recently I'm working on Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), which has potential to apply in warehouse management or logistics.
