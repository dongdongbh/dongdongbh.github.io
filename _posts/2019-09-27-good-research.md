Recently, a friend of mine shared that he has learned a lot from my posts and GitHub repositories. Knowing that my work is helpful to others brings me immense joy and motivates me to continue updating my site.

In this post, I’d like to share my thoughts on how to be a good researcher.

## What Makes Research "Good"?

First, let’s define what makes research "good."

> Many people think a good researcher is someone who has published a lot of papers. However, in my view, **quality matters more than quantity.**

So, how do we define the quality of a research paper?

> Many believe that a good paper is one with a high number of citations. While citation count is certainly a useful metric, I believe that a truly outstanding paper is one that continues to receive citations even a decade or more after publication. A good piece of research either introduces a profound theoretical insight or proposes a method that significantly influences its field.

## How to Start?

The first step is to ask yourself if you truly want to pursue research. In my opinion, a researcher should have a strong desire to improve and innovate—to make things better.

If you feel deeply motivated to engage in research, here are some tips to help you get started:

- **Read in English**: Always prioritize reading original research papers or books in English. If you need clarification, you can refer to blogs or other resources, but avoid relying on translations, even if they are well done. Reading in the original language ensures you grasp the author's exact ideas and nuances.

- **Think deeply**: When reading a paper, ask yourself: *What is the underlying reason this works? Are there any gaps or areas for improvement?* If you don’t understand something at first, dig deeper. Try to fully comprehend the content, and if needed, examine source code or implementation details. A good researcher isn’t just a skilled coder—they’re a critical thinker who seeks the fundamental principles behind ideas.

- **Improve your English writing**: This includes not only grammar and vocabulary but also the **logical structure** of your writing. Clear, logical communication is essential for sharing your ideas effectively.

- **Strive for excellence**: Avoid a mindset of "good enough." Cultivate a passion for understanding things thoroughly and striving for the best possible results. A certain level of "productive obsession" or meticulousness can be very helpful.

- **Trust your intuition**: While it’s important to learn from others, don’t blindly follow authority. Let your curiosity and intuition guide you toward innovative ideas.

By following these principles, I hope you’ll find both fulfillment and success in your research journey. Remember, research is not just about producing papers—it’s about making a meaningful impact.
