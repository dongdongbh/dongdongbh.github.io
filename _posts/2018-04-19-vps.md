# set up a VPS on Google cloud
1. buy a VM on [Google cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) (it has one year free trial now)
    choose Debian Linux and the place near to get fast access (eg, `asia-east`, `asia-noutheast`)
2. use ssh connect VPS (you can use browser ssh or ssh key on terminal)
3. configure you VPS
4. configure you client

## set up BBR and ssr
* set up BBR and ssr through script on VPS connected by ssh
```
sudo -i
wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/iyuco/scripts/raw/master/bbr.sh
chmod +x bbr.sh
./bbr.sh
./shadowsocksR.sh
```
* set you Google cloud firewall to allow your ssr port in both http and https

## set up Linux PC client

### set up ssr
    ```
    wget http://www.djangoz.com/ssr
    sudo mv ssr /usr/local/bin
    sudo chmod 766 /usr/local/bin/ssr
    ssr install
    ssr config
    ```

### using ssr on terminal
1. `sudo apt-get install privoxy`

2. edit /etc/privoxy/config, below is an example
    ```
    listen-address localhost:8118
    forward-socks5 /127.0.0.1:1080.
    ```

3. `sudo /etc/init.d/privoxy restart`

4. configure terminal environment
```
export http_proxy="127.0.0.1:8118"
export https_proxy="127.0.0.1:8118"
```

5. try `wget http://www.google.com` to test.

### Chrome management
if you want to use chrome to manage your redirection, you can use `Proxy SwitchyOmega` extension.

## set up other clients
* IOS (wingy)
* Windows ([ShadowsocksR-win](https://github.com/shadowsocksr-rm/shadowsocksr-csharp))
*  MAC ([ShadowsocksX](https://github.com/shadowsocks/ShadowsocksX-NG))
* Android([shadowsocksr-android](https://github.com/milkice233/shadowsocksr-android))
