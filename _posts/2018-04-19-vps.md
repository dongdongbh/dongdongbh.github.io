### **Background**

**Network freedom** is essential for everyone, especially for programmers and researchers. However, due to well-known reasons, there are barriers in mainland China that restrict access to certain websites (e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc.). Initially, this post was intended as a personal note about how to bypass these network barriers. However, many of my friends kept asking me how to achieve network freedom in China. Therefore, I revised this post to make it clearer and easier to understand. I hope this guide helps you perform better in your learning and development.

As individuals, we must develop the ability to discern which information on the Internet can be trusted. Here, I **claim** that this post is strictly for **learning and research purposes**.

If you plan to **buy a VPN** (proxy), you may not need to read this post. Most VPN vendors provide shared proxy servers with bandwidth limitations, which can result in slow speeds. Moreover, you might have concerns about data monitoring by these vendors. By creating your own proxy server, you can enjoy exclusive bandwidth and greater control over your data. If this appeals to you, read on to learn how to set it up. If anything is unclear, feel free to leave a comment.

A **Virtual Private Server (VPS)** is a virtual machine hosted on the cloud and used by individuals. Companies like Google, Amazon, AWS, Alibaba, and Tencent provide servers to customers, which can be used for website hosting, computation, proxy setup, etc.

This post explains how to set up a Google VPS and configure a network proxy server on it. For instructions on setting up a website on a VPS, refer to my post—[Create Your Website on Cloud](<https://dongdongbh.tech/resource/create-website/>).

### **Requirements**

1. **Temporary VPN Access**:  
   To visit Google and set up your server, you need temporary VPN access. After your server is configured, you can switch to your own service and no longer need the temporary VPN.  
   > How to get temporary VPN access?  
   > You can find a VPN vendor and start a free trial. Lol.

2. **Basic Computer Knowledge**:  
   Familiarity with computer systems (especially **Linux**) is necessary. Otherwise, it may be challenging to understand some terms and implement these steps. If you lack experience, consider following step-by-step video tutorials on platforms like YouTube by searching for **SSR** and **V2Ray**.

### **1. Set Up Cloud Virtual Private Server (VPS)**

You can use any server capable of accessing the open Internet. Most servers outside of China work well, and you can purchase a mini-server from a cloud provider like Google, AWS, or BandwagonHost. Mini-servers are typically affordable, and payment can be made using a dual-currency credit card. This section demonstrates how to set up a server on Google Cloud.

1. **Purchase a VM**:  
   Visit [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) (currently offering a **one-year free trial**) or any other vendor. Choose **Debian Linux** as the operating system and select a location close to China for better access speed (e.g., `asia-east`, `asia-northeast`, `Hong Kong`, `Seoul`).

2. **SSH Connection**:  
   Connect to your VPS using SSH. You can use a browser-based SSH client or set up an SSH key in your terminal.

3. **Address Slow SSH Connections**:  
   If SSH is slow, it may be due to issues with port 22. Modify the configuration to add additional ports:
   ```bash
   cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.backup
   sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```
   Remove the `#` before `Port 22` and add a new port, e.g., `Port xxxxx`.  
   Note: Do not delete `Port 22`. If the new port becomes inaccessible, you will still have access via port 22.  
   Restart the SSH service:
   ```bash
   systemctl restart sshd  # or
   /etc/init.d/sshd restart
   ```

   To connect using the new port:
   ```bash
   ssh -p xxxxx user@ip
   scp -P xxxxx username@server:(remote location) (local location)
   ```

4. **Verify Open Ports**:  
   Use the following command to check open ports:
   ```bash
   sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
   ```

### **2. Set Up Proxy Server**

There are two popular methods to bypass network restrictions: **SSR (ShadowsocksR)** and **V2Ray**.

#### **2.1 Set Up BBR and SSR**

1. Install BBR and SSR using scripts:
   ```bash
   sudo -i
   wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/iyuco/scripts/raw/master/bbr.sh
   chmod +x bbr.sh
   ./bbr.sh

   wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teddysun/shadowsocks_install/master/shadowsocksR.sh
   ./shadowsocksR.sh
   ```

2. For multi-user accounts, use this script:
   ```bash
   wget -N --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToyoDAdoubi/doubi/master/ssrmu.sh
   chmod +x ssrmu.sh
   bash ssrmu.sh
   ```

**Note**: Ensure your cloud server’s firewall allows the SSR port for both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

---

#### **2.2 Set Up V2Ray**

V2Ray is a more robust platform with features like multi-hop configurations and network penetration. It supports the **VMess** protocol and is generally more stable than SSR.

1. Install V2Ray:
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v2fly/fhs-install-v2ray/master/install-release.sh)
   ```

2. Synchronize the server’s time:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ntp ntpdate -y
   sudo ntpdate -u ntp.api.bz
   sudo hwclock -w  # Write time to hardware
   ```

3. Update the `config.json` file in `/etc/v2ray/`.

4. Start V2Ray:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start v2ray
   ```

5. Configure WebSocket+TLS+Nginx:  
   If you already have a website hosted on your server, refer to the [V2Ray WebSocket+TLS+Nginx Guide](<https://toutyrater.github.io/advanced/wss_and_web.html>).

### **3. Set Up Linux PC Client**

---

#### **3.1 Set Up SSR**

1. Download and install the SSR client:
   ```bash
   wget http://www.djangoz.com/ssr
   sudo mv ssr /usr/local/bin
   sudo chmod 766 /usr/local/bin/ssr
   ssr install
   ssr config  # This installs SSR to /usr/local/share/shadowsocksr
   ```

---

#### **3.2 Set Up V2Ray Client**

The steps are similar to setting up the server:

1. **Synchronize Time**:  
   Use the same time synchronization steps as on the server.

2. **Download Install Script**:  
   ```bash
   wget https://install.direct/go.sh
   ```

3. **Run Installation**:  
   ```bash
   sudo go.sh
   ```

4. **Configure `config.json`**:  
   Replace the default configuration file in `/etc/v2ray/` with your own `config.json`.

5. **Start V2Ray**:  
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start v2ray
   ```

6. **Check Service Status**:  
   ```bash
   service v2ray status
   ```

### **4. Using SOCKS on Terminal with Privoxy**

---

Privoxy is a tool that listens on a specific port and forwards its traffic to user-defined SOCKS proxies.

#### **Privoxy Setup**

1. Install Privoxy:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install privoxy
   ```

2. Configure Privoxy by editing `/etc/privoxy/config`. Example configuration:
   ```bash
   listen-address 127.0.0.1:8118  # Line 783
   forward-socks5 / 127.0.0.1:1080 .  # Line 1336
   ```

3. Restart Privoxy:
   ```bash
   sudo /etc/init.d/privoxy restart
   ```

---

#### **Configure Bash**

1. Add proxy settings to `.bashrc`:
   ```bash
   export http_proxy="http://127.0.0.1:8118"
   export https_proxy="http://127.0.0.1:8118"
   ```

   Alternatively, set up functions to toggle proxy settings manually:
   ```bash
   # Set Proxy
   function setproxy() {
       export {http,https,ftp}_proxy="http://127.0.0.1:8118"
       export {HTTP,HTTPS,FTP}_PROXY="http://127.0.0.1:8118"
   }

   # Unset Proxy
   function unsetproxy() {
       unset {http,https,ftp}_proxy
       unset {HTTP,HTTPS,FTP}_PROXY
   }
   ```

2. Test the proxy:
   ```bash
   curl http://www.google.com
   ```

   **Note**: The `ping` command cannot be used to test proxy settings, as it uses the ICMP protocol. Use `httping` to test latency:
   ```bash
   httping -E http://www.google.com
   httping -x 127.0.0.1:8118 http://www.google.com
   ```

#### **Snap Store with Proxy**

1. Apply proxy settings system-wide by editing `/etc/environment`:
   ```bash
   http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8118
   https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8118
   HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8118
   HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8118
   ```

2. For `snap` version 2.28 or higher, set the proxy:
   ```bash
   sudo snap set system proxy.http="http://127.0.0.1:8118"
   sudo snap set system proxy.https="http://127.0.0.1:8118"
   ```

3. Alternatively, edit the `snapd.service` file:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl edit snapd.service
   ```

   Add the following lines:
   ```
   [Service]
   Environment=http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8118
   Environment=https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8118
   ```

4. Reload and restart the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart snapd.service
   ```

---

#### **Apt Use Proxy**

1. Configure APT to use the proxy:
   ```bash
   sudo vim /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/05proxy
   ```

2. Add the following lines:
   ```
   Acquire {
       HTTP::proxy "http://127.0.0.1:8118";
       HTTPS::proxy "http://127.0.0.1:8118";
   }
   ```

---

#### **Set Up Git Proxy**

1. Configure Git to use the proxy:
   ```bash
   git config --global http.proxy 'socks5://127.0.0.1:1080'
   git config --global https.proxy 'socks5://127.0.0.1:1080'
   ```

---

#### **Chrome Management**

For Chrome, use the **Proxy SwitchyOmega** extension to manage proxy settings easily.
