#### **1. Install and Configure OpenSSH Server**

1. Install the SSH server:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install openssh-server
   ```

2. Edit the SSH server configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo subl /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```

3. Restart the SSH service to apply changes:
   ```bash
   sudo service ssh restart
   ```

#### **2. Enable GUI Forwarding**

##### **On the Server**

Modify the SSH server configuration file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

- Set the following options:
  ```
  X11Forwarding yes
  X11DisplayOffset 10
  X11UseLocalhost no
  ForwardAgent yes
  ForwardX11 yes
  ForwardX11Trusted yes
  ```

##### **On the Client**

1. Connect to the remote host with X11 forwarding:
   ```bash
   ssh -X remote_host(ip)
   ```

2. Test the GUI forwarding by running a graphical application like `xclock`:
   ```bash
   ssh -X user@host_ip
   xclock
   ```

   If the graphical clock appears, X11 forwarding is correctly configured.

#### **3. File Transfer with SCP**

Use the `scp` command to securely copy files or directories between local and remote systems:

- Copy a single file:
  ```bash
  scp <file> <username>@<IP address or hostname>:<Destination>
  ```

- Copy a directory recursively to the local system:
  ```bash
  scp -r username@server:(remote location) (local location)
  ```

- Copy a directory recursively to the remote system:
  ```bash
  scp -r (local location) username@server:(remote location)
  ```

---

With these steps, you can configure an SSH server, enable GUI forwarding, and securely transfer files between systems.
