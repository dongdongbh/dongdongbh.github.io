### **What is GTD?**

**Getting Things Done (GTD)** is a personal productivity methodology created by David Allen. The core idea is simple: your brain is for having ideas, not holding them. By capturing everything that has your attention into a trusted system, you free your mind to focus on the task at hand.

GTD consists of five key steps:

1. **Capture** - Collect everything that has your attention into an inbox
2. **Clarify** - Process each item: Is it actionable? What's the next action?
3. **Organize** - Put items where they belong (projects, contexts, calendar, reference)
4. **Reflect** - Review your system regularly (Weekly Review)
5. **Engage** - Do the work with confidence

### **Why GTD Works**

Unlike simple todo lists, GTD addresses the psychological burden of "open loops" - all those things you've committed to but haven't organized. When you trust your system, you can:

- **Reduce stress** - Nothing falls through the cracks
- **Focus better** - Your mind isn't trying to remember everything
- **Make better decisions** - Clear context about what you could be doing
- **Stay on top of projects** - Track next actions, not just outcomes
- **Do meaningful Weekly Reviews** - Regularly recalibrate priorities

### **The Problem: No Free, Open-Source GTD Apps**

While there are many GTD apps available (OmniFocus, Things 3, Todoist), they share common limitations:

- **Expensive subscriptions** or one-time purchases
- **Closed source** - No way to customize or extend
- **Vendor lock-in** - Your data is trapped in their ecosystem
- **Not truly GTD** - Most are just fancy todo lists

I wanted an app that:
- Implements **real GTD workflows** (inbox processing, contexts, Weekly Review)
- Is **completely free and open-source**
- Stores data **locally** (with optional sync via Dropbox/Syncthing)
- Works on **both desktop and mobile**

So I built one.

### **The "Vibe Coding" Story**

I'll be honest: much of this app was **vibe coded**. I had the vision, I knew what GTD should feel like, and I built it iteratively - feature by feature, fixing bugs as they appeared, refactoring when things got messy.

The tech stack:
- **Monorepo** with shared core logic
- **Desktop**: Tauri v2 (Rust) + React + Vite + Tailwind
- **Mobile**: Expo + React Native + NativeWind
- **State**: Zustand (shared between platforms)

It's not perfect, but it works. And because it's open source, it can get better.
