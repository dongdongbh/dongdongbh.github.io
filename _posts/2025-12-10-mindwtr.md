description: A local-first, open-source GTD app for desktop and mobile
---

I started Mindwtr because I could not find a GTD app that felt honest. Most of the tools I tried were locked behind subscriptions, built around a central server, or missing big pieces of the GTD workflow. Some teams never listened to users. Others focused on Apple-only polish and left Android and Linux behind. I wanted a calm, local-first system that worked for how I actually think, and I wanted it to stay free. So I built it.

This is a story about a tool growing out of daily friction: the friction of paying to access your own tasks, the friction of cloud lock-in, the friction of apps that do not respect GTD as a full method. I wanted a place to capture everything, process it with clarity, and trust it enough to get work done.

Over time, Mindwtr became that place. It kept the core GTD flow intact: capture, clarify, organize, reflect, engage. It kept the data local by default, with optional sync through your own folders or WebDAV. It stayed open source and community-driven. And it grew into a full, daily companion across desktop and mobile.

### What GTD means to me

Getting Things Done (GTD) is a productivity method created by David Allen. The core idea is simple: your brain is for having ideas, not holding them. Capture everything that has your attention into a trusted system, then work it through a clear process.

When an app skips pieces of this flow, it becomes a fancy list. I wanted the whole system: inbox processing, projects with next actions, context lists, waiting-for and someday lists, and a real weekly review.

### How Mindwtr grew

Mindwtr started as a personal itch. Then it became a tool I could share. The more people used it, the more it became a collaboration. The app picked up features that make daily work smoother, but still keeps the GTD backbone visible and honest:

- Voice input and quick capture that lets ideas land fast.
- Sync that respects your choice: file-based sync, Syncthing, WebDAV, or self-hosted cloud.
- AI Assistant for structured capture and faster processing.
- Android home screen widgets for a fast glance and quick add.
- Markdown notes so projects and tasks can hold real context.
- External calendars alongside your tasks.
- MCP Server for people who want automation and integrations.
- Desktop-first keyboard workflows and mobile gestures that match how you move through your day.

None of these features are here to chase trends. They exist to make the GTD flow easier to live with.

### Community makes it better

Mindwtr is still evolving. The best improvements so far have come from people who actually use the app and report what feels off. If you have feedback, open an issue. If you want to contribute, send a PR. This app will stay free, and it will keep getting better with community help.

If you want a GTD tool that respects your data, your attention, and your workflow, I hope Mindwtr feels like home.

Thanks for being part of the story.
