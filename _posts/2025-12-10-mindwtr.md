description: A local-first, open-source GTD app for desktop and mobile
---

Mindwtr is a free, open-source GTD app built for people who want calm, local-first productivity on both desktop and mobile. I wanted a real GTD flow without subscriptions, lock-in, or dark UX patterns, so I built the tool I wanted to use every day.

### Why I built it

- I wanted a GTD app that feels honest and simple, not a gamified todo list.
- I wanted local-first data with optional sync to any folder (Dropbox, Syncthing, etc.).
- I wanted one codebase that works on desktop and mobile with the same core workflow.

### What is GTD?

Getting Things Done (GTD) is a productivity method created by David Allen. The core idea is simple: your brain is for having ideas, not holding them. Capture everything that has your attention into a trusted system, then work it through a clear process.

GTD has five steps:

1. Capture - collect everything into an inbox
2. Clarify - decide what each item means and the next action
3. Organize - file items into projects, contexts, calendar, or reference
4. Reflect - review regularly (Weekly Review)
5. Engage - do the work with confidence
