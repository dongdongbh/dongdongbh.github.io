description: A personal update on how Mindwtr evolved into my daily local-first GTD system
---

I started Mindwtr because I wanted a GTD app I could trust long term.

Not "trust" in a marketing way. I mean trust as in:
- my tasks are mine
- the workflow stays clear
- the app still works even if a service changes, a plan expires, or an integration disappears

That was the original idea. Over time, it turned into the app I now use every day across desktop and mobile.

The GTD backbone is still the same: capture, clarify, organize, reflect, engage. What changed is the polish, reliability, and ecosystem around it.

## What changed recently

The last releases focused less on flashy features and more on making the system feel solid in real life.

- Sync/data integrity got a lot stronger (conflict handling, timestamp safety, attachment consistency, stricter storage validation).
- Mobile got much better day to day (navigation fixes on iOS, keyboard/input polish on Android, better inbox/review flow).
- AI support expanded with local OpenAI-compatible endpoints (for example Ollama/LM Studio/LocalAI/vLLM), so "AI assist" can stay local if you want.
- Packaging/distribution is healthier: App Store/TestFlight flow fixes, Microsoft Store improvements, official Homebrew cask automation, and wider Linux coverage.
- Docs and workflows were cleaned up so release and maintenance are less fragile.

These are boring updates on paper, but they matter most when you depend on the app every day.

## Still local-first, still open

Mindwtr is still:
- local-first
- open source
- free to use
- focused on GTD instead of endless feature sprawl

You can keep it simple, or go deeper with automation (CLI, local API, MCP server), but the default experience stays calm.

## If you are new here

The quickest way to see what Mindwtr supports right now is the README:

- README: [https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr](https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr)

For detailed setup and behavior docs, use the wiki:

- Wiki home: [https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr/wiki](https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr/wiki)
- Data and Sync details: [https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr/wiki/Data-and-Sync](https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr/wiki/Data-and-Sync)

I keep README concise on purpose. Sync details and backend behavior live in the wiki where they are easier to maintain.

## Community notes

The best changes usually come from real usage reports, not abstract ideas.

If you want to help, please open GitHub issues/discussions instead of sending private feedback. It helps track problems, avoids duplicated work, and makes fixes visible to everyone.

Thanks again to everyone testing, reporting, and contributing. Mindwtr is much better because of you.

I am still building it with the same goal as day one: a calm, trustworthy GTD system that respects your data and your attention.
