description: Why I built Mindwtr, the project philosophy, and how a FOSS GTD app helps in daily life
---

I built Mindwtr because I could not find a task app that matched how I actually live and think.

I wanted something calm, fast, and honest. Not a product designed to maximize screen time. Not a tool that makes me pay forever just to keep access to my own tasks. And not an app that treats GTD like a checklist of trendy features.

I wanted a system I could trust for years:
- my data stays mine
- the workflow stays clear
- the app stays useful even without a central hosted service

So I started building Mindwtr.

## Why GTD, and why this style

For me, GTD is not about being "productive" in a social-media sense. It is about mental clarity.

My brain works better when it does not need to remember everything. GTD gives me a reliable loop:
- capture what has my attention
- clarify what it means
- organize it in the right place
- review regularly
- engage with confidence

Mindwtr is built around that loop. If an app skips these parts, it becomes a list manager. I wanted a full practice, not a bucket of todos.

## Philosophy of the project

Mindwtr follows a simple principle:
**simple by default, powerful when needed.**

That means:
- progressive disclosure: advanced options appear when they matter
- less by default: fewer knobs, less noise, less cognitive load
- avoid feature creep: clarity over clutter
- local-first foundation: your system should work even when the internet is unreliable
- practical cross-platform: desktop and mobile should feel like one trusted system

I want Mindwtr to feel like a quiet workspace, not a cockpit.

## How it helps in daily life

Most of the value is not dramatic. It is small, repeated relief.

- In the morning, I can quickly see what deserves attention today.
- During the day, I can capture tasks before they disappear from memory.
- When I feel overloaded, I can process inbox items and turn ambiguity into clear next actions.
- In weekly review, I can reset direction instead of drifting.
- Across devices, I can keep one trusted system instead of scattered notes and reminders.

That is the core promise: less mental friction, better decisions, and more calm.

## Why FOSS matters here

Mindwtr is free and open source because this kind of tool should be inspectable, adaptable, and community-owned.

FOSS means:
- no lock-in by design
- transparent behavior
- contributions from real users
- long-term sustainability beyond one company roadmap

If something feels wrong, anyone can report it. If something can be better, anyone can improve it. That keeps the project honest.

## Closing

Mindwtr started as a personal need, but it became a shared tool for people who want a practical GTD system without noise, lock-in, or subscription pressure.
