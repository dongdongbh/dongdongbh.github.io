## Background

Machine learning algorithms often require significant computational resources. These systems are typically large, noisy, and primarily run on Linux servers. As a result, most developers work on remote servers. Setting up a seamless remote development environment is crucial for productivity.

Here are the key components to configure:

- **SSH**
- **File transfer with the server**
- **Remote UI**
- **Machine learning environment**
- **Remote development tools**
- **Additional configurations**

**Note:** If you're in **mainland China**, it's advisable to set up a proxy to bypass the [Great Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall). This ensures smooth access to required resources during setup, such as downloading packages. For details on setting up a proxy, refer to [Set Up VPS](https://dongdongbh.tech/blog/vps/).

## SSH

SSH is the foundation for connecting to your remote server. Follow this [guide for passwordless SSH](http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html).

- **On Linux:** Follow standard SSH setup instructions.
- **On Windows:** Use a Bash environment like [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/), [Git Bash](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads), or [wsl-terminal](https://github.com/goreliu/wsl-terminal).

### Rename Your SSH Server
Edit `~/.ssh/config` to define an alias:
```bash
Host my_server
    HostName example.com   # IP or domain name
    User root              # Username
```
Now, connect using:
```bash
ssh my_server
```

### Advanced SSH Configurations
- For SSH tunneling through a **jumper machine**, see my [SSH tunnel guide](https://dongdongbh.github.io/note/#/server).
- If your server requires a **VPN with SSL**, and the client is only available for Windows, refer to [Enabling SSL VPN on Linux](https://dongdongbh.tech/enabling-ssl-VPN-on-linux/).

## File Transfer with the Server

Refer to [Transfer Files](https://dongdongbh.tech/markup/file-transport/) for detailed instructions on using `scp` or `sshfs`.

## Machine Learning Environment

### 1. Basic Tools
Install essential utilities:
```bash
sudo apt install git vim tmux htop
```
Create a script for automated setup. A ready-made script will be published on my [GitHub](https://github.com).

### 2. Development Frameworks
Popular machine learning frameworks include:
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
- CUDA drivers

### 3. Python Environment
Remote servers often use Python. To manage environments efficiently, use tools like [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/).

**Why use a virtual environment?**
- Isolate your setup from the system environment to avoid conflicts.
- Simplify portability across servers.

**Basic `conda` Commands**:
```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.8
conda activate myenv
conda install numpy
conda deactivate
```
For more, see the [Conda Command Reference](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands.html).

## Remote Development Tools

### 1. Jupyter Notebook
Set up Jupyter for interactive coding and visualization. For more, refer to [Jupyter Configuration](https://dongdongbh.github.io/note/#/remote-visit-https).

**GPU Settings**:
Add this line to your `~/.bashrc` for GPU control:
```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1
```

### 2. TensorBoard
TensorBoard helps monitor and debug your algorithms. Access it through a browser after setup.

### 3. PyCharm
PyCharm integrates seamlessly with remote servers for editing, running, and debugging code. For setup, see this [PyCharm Remote Development Guide](https://medium.com/@erikhallstrm/work-remotely-with-pycharm-tensorflow-and-ssh-c60564be862d).

### 4. VS Code
VS Code allows remote file editing but lacks built-in remote execution. Refer to [Remote Development with VS Code](https://matttrent.com/remote-development/).

## View Remote UI on Local Machine

- **On Linux**: Use X11 forwarding:
  ```bash
  ssh -X user@server
  ```
  Test it by running `xclock` on the remote server. A clock UI should appear on your local machine.

- **On Windows**: Install and run an X11 server like [Xming](http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/).
