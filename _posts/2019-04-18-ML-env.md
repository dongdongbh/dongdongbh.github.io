## set up machine learning environment

### background

Machine learning algorithm always need lots of computing resource, generally, the computer is big and noisy, and most of them are host on Linux system, so most of us run our code on a remote server. How to set up the remote development environment to make us work smoothly is really important.

There including several stuff we have to set up:

* ssh 
* file transfer with server
* remote development tool
* UI on remote
* machine learning environment
* others

### ssh

basically, we should visit our remote sever through ssh connection. refer this for [ssh without password](<http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html>). 

on Linux PC, just follow the basic tutorial, on Windows, you first need a bash environment, I recommend some bash env. based on mintty, such as [Cygwin](<http://cygwin.com/>), [git bash](<https://www.git-scm.com/downloads>) or [wsl-terminal](<https://github.com/goreliu/wsl-terminal>), 

you can rename your ssh sever by edit `~/.ssh/config`, eg.

```
Host my_server                       
    HostName example.com           # ip or domain name
    User root                      # user name
```

then your can just visit your server by `ssh my_server`

### file transfer with server

just refer my another post  [Transfer files](<https://dongdongbh.tech/markup/file-transport/>), using scp or sshfs.

### remote development tool

1. basic tools

   just install some basic tools on Linux, such as 

   > git vim tmux htop 
   >
   > you can write a shell scrip to do all that

2.
