description: Transparent proxy with V2ray and clash on Linuxï¼Œbypass gateway, soft router
---



---

## Background

In my [previous post](https://dongdongbh.tech/blog/vps/), I demonstrated how to set up a proxy server and configure clients on various devices. However, configuring the proxy client on each device can be cumbersome. Additionally, some users may prefer to route all network traffic through a proxy, regardless of whether it's HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS5, or other protocols. In such cases, setting up a **transparent proxy** is more convenient. This proxy acts as a router, enabling all connected devices (including the host itself) to use the proxy. Transparent proxies are also referred to as bypass gateways or soft routers and typically work on TCP/UDP protocols.

This post will guide you step-by-step on setting up a transparent proxy on Linux. To follow along, you should have basic knowledge of Linux and networking.

There are various tools to achieve transparent proxy functionality, such as Proxifier (Windows), *Surge for Mac*, tun2socks, and dns2socks for Linux. The key to implementing a transparent proxy lies in correctly handling **DNS resolution**. In this post, I use the built-in DNS configurations of **V2Ray** and **Clash**. DNS requests are forwarded using `iptables` and `ip route`. Notably, Clash offers robust DNS settings.

## Basics

### How DNS Works

When you make an HTTP request, the system first sends a DNS query (UDP port 53) with the domain name to the configured DNS server. The server responds with the corresponding IP address. The application then establishes a TCP connection to the target server using this IP and begins data exchange.

A typical connection flow looks like this:

```
            DNS Query
   ___________________________>
APP<---------------------------DNS Server
  |         Response (IP)
  |         TCP Data Exchange
  |----------------------------------->Website  
```

When using a proxy, the flow changes. Below are scenarios for different proxy types:

---

#### SOCKS5 Proxy

In the SOCKS5 case, the application packs the domain name and TCP data into a SOCKS5 protocol packet. The proxy client forwards this packet to the proxy server, where DNS resolution occurs.

```
      SOCKS5 (Domain + TCP Data)                    SOCKS5 Data / Proxy Protocol                          DNS Query
APP--------------------------------->Proxy Client------------------------------------->Proxy Server<------------------->DNS Server
                                                                                          |     Response (IP)
                                                                                          |
                                                                                          |     TCP Data
                                                                                          |--------------------------------Website  
```

In **global/transparent proxy** setups, not all applications can handle SOCKS5. Thus, a program must intercept DNS requests and process them appropriately.

---

#### tun2socks/redir

**tun2socks** (part of BadVPN) intercepts all incoming TCP connections (regardless of destination IP) and forwards them to a SOCKS server. This method allows applications to use SOCKS without built-in support, even on a Linux router.

In this case, the application sends a DNS request, receives an IP (possibly inaccurate due to a "dirty" DNS server), and then establishes a TCP connection. The local proxy client intercepts and repackages the domain and TCP data into a SOCKS5 packet for forwarding.

```
         Requested IP
   <_________________________________              Domain + Data (Proxy Protocol)                      DNS Query
APP--------------------------------->Proxy Client<------------------------------------->Proxy Server<------------------->DNS Server
  |              DNS Query             /|\                                                  |     Response (IP)
  |                                     |                                                   |
  |       TCP Data                      |                                                   |     TCP Data     
  |-------------------------------------|                                                   |---------------------------->Website
```

---

#### Fake IP Mode

In this mode, the local proxy client intercepts DNS requests and returns a "fake" IP to the application. The application establishes a connection with the fake IP, while the proxy client maps the fake IP to the actual domain and forwards the data to the proxy server.

```
          Fake IP
   <_________________________________                  Domain + Data (Proxy Protocol)                    DNS Query
APP--------------------------------->Proxy Client<------------------------------------->Proxy Server<------------------->DNS Server
  |              DNS Query             /|\                                                  |     Response (IP)
  |                                     |                                                   |
  |   TCP Data                          |                                                   |     TCP Data     
  |-------------------------------------|                                                   |---------------------------->Website
```

**Advantages & Disadvantages**:

- **Fake IP Mode**: Faster, as the real IP doesn't need to be sent to the application. However, the application cannot determine the website's real IP.
- **Real IP Mode**: Slower, but more accurate for applications requiring the actual IP.

### `iptables`

To manipulate traffic for transparent proxies, familiarity with `iptables` is essential. Here's an overview:

![iptables Overview](../../assets/images/tproxy/iptable.webp)

Basic `iptables` commands:

```bash
iptables -L -t {nat,mangle}   # List chains
iptables -N XXXX              # Create chain
iptables -A ...               # Add rule
iptables -D ...               # Delete rule
```

## Requirements

- A Linux machine.
- An operational V2Ray or Clash proxy.

---

## Setting Up a V2Ray Transparent Proxy

### V2Ray Configuration (`config.json`)

The `dokodemo-door` inbound receives all traffic redirected by `iptables`. Traffic processed by V2Ray is marked with socket mark `255 (0xFF)` to avoid loopback.

```json
{
  "routing": {...},
  "inbounds": [
    {
      ...
    },
    {
      "port": 12345,
      "protocol": "dokodemo-door",
      "settings": {
        "network": "tcp,udp",
        "followRedirect": true
      },
      "sniffing": {
        "enabled": true,
        "destOverride": ["http", "tls"]
      },
      "streamSettings": {
        "sockopt": {
          "tproxy": "redirect"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "outbounds": [
    {
      ...
      "streamSettings": {
        ...
        "sockopt": {
          "mark": 255
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### `iptables` Configuration

Run these commands with root privileges (`sudo su`):

```bash
lan_ipaddr="192.168.1.1"  # Local router IP
proxy_server="123.123.123.123"  # Proxy server IP
proxy_port="7892"  # Transparent proxy port

# Enable IP forwarding
echo net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 >> /etc/sysctl.conf && sysctl -p

# Route for loopback
ip rule add fwmark 1 table 100
ip route add local 0.0.0.0/0 dev lo table 100

# Proxy local network
iptables -t mangle -N V2RAY
iptables -t mangle -A V2RAY -d ${proxy_server} -j RETURN
iptables -t mangle -A V2RAY -d 127.0.0.1/32 -j RETURN
...
```

This method uses the **REDIRECT** approach. For the **TPROXY** method, refer to [this guide](https://toutyrater.github.io/app/tproxy.html).


## Setting Up a Clash Transparent Proxy

Clash is a powerful, rule-based proxy tool with features like high-level routing and DNS management. It is widely used due to its flexibility and robust capabilities.

### Configuring Clash as a Bypass Gateway

If you're using a Raspberry Pi as a bypass gateway, you can set a static IP address for it and configure it to act as both a DHCP and DNS server. Alternatively, if your main router supports multiple gateways, you can configure two gateways:

1. One for traffic routed through the Raspberry Pi (for proxying).
2. Another for direct routing (normal internet access).

The network overview would look like this:

```
Phone/PC/Pad
        |
      1 |
        |
+-------v-------+      2      +---------------+
|               |------------->               |
|  WiFi Router  |             |  Raspberry Pi |
|               <-------------|               |
+------+--+-----+      3      +---------------+
       |  |
    3.1|  | 3.2
       |  +---------->  Direct LAN
       v
   +---+---+
   | Proxy |
   +---+---+
       |
       |
       v
 Internet WAN
```

### Avoiding Loop Problems

To prevent traffic loops, create a dedicated user `clash` and ensure that traffic originating from this user is excluded from the proxying rules. 

#### Steps to Create a User for Clash

1. Create the `clash` user and its home directory:

```bash
sudo useradd -U clash
sudo mkhomedir_helper clash
sudo chown clash:clash /usr/local/bin/clash
```

2. Create or modify the service file at `/etc/systemd/system/clash.service` to define the user as `clash`:

```text
[Unit]
Description=clash
After=network.target

[Service]
User=clash
Group=clash
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE CAP_NET_ADMIN
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/clash -d /etc/clash
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`: Allows the Clash process to bind to privileged ports like 53 (DNS).
- `CAP_NET_ADMIN`: Grants the Clash process permissions for network administration (necessary for UDP proxying).

3. Reload the systemd configuration and enable Clash:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable clash
```

---

### Clash DNS Configuration

To ensure reliable DNS resolution, configure Clash to handle DNS queries. Below is a sample DNS configuration for `config.yaml`:

```yaml
dns:
  enable: true
  ipv6: false
  listen: 0.0.0.0:1053
  enhanced-mode: redir-host       # Modes: redir-host or fake-ip
  use-hosts: true                 # Use hosts for resolution
  nameserver:
    - 119.29.29.29      # DNSPod
    - 223.5.5.5         # Alibaba DNS
  fallback:
    - tls://8.8.8.8:853         # Google DNS over TLS
    - tls://8.8.4.4:853         # Google DNS over TLS
    - https://1.1.1.1/dns-query # Cloudflare DNS over HTTPS
    - https://dns.google/dns-query # Google DNS over HTTPS
  fallback-filter:
    geoip: true
```

For **fake-ip** mode, update the configuration:

```yaml
  enhanced-mode: fake-ip
  fake-ip-range: 198.18.0.1/16  # Fake IP pool
```

---

### Clash Full Configuration Example

Below is a complete example of `config.yaml`:

```yaml
port: 7890
socks-port: 7891
redir-port: 7892
allow-lan: true
mode: Rule
log-level: info
external-controller: 0.0.0.0:9090
secret: ""
external-ui: dashboard

# Define proxies
proxies:
  - name: "Proxy"
    type: http
    server: your.proxy.server
    port: 1234
    username: user
    password: pass

# Proxy groups and rules
proxy-groups:
  - name: "Default"
    type: select
    proxies:
      - Proxy

rules:
  - DOMAIN-SUFFIX,example.com,Default
  - GEOIP,CN,DIRECT
  - MATCH,Default

dns:
  enable: true
  ipv6: false
  listen: 0.0.0.0:1053
  enhanced-mode: redir-host
  nameserver:
    - 119.29.29.29
    - 223.5.5.5
  fallback:
    - tls://8.8.8.8:853
    - tls://8.8.4.4:853
    - https://1.1.1.1/dns-query
    - https://dns.google/dns-query
  fallback-filter:
    geoip: true
```

---

### Configuring `iptables` for Clash

1. Enable IP forwarding:

```bash
echo net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 >> /etc/sysctl.conf && sysctl -p
```

2. Create a script to set up `iptables` rules:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

IPT=/sbin/iptables
lan_ipaddr=$(/sbin/ip route | awk '/default/ { print $3 }')
dns_port="1053"  
proxy_port="7892" 

# Flush existing rules
$IPT -F

# Create chains
$IPT -t nat -N CLASH_TCP_RULE
$IPT -t nat -F CLASH_TCP_RULE

# Exclude local addresses
$IPT -t nat -A CLASH_TCP_RULE -d 10.0.0.0/8 -j RETURN
$IPT -t nat -A CLASH_TCP_RULE -d 127.0.0.0/8 -j RETURN
$IPT -t nat -A CLASH_TCP_RULE -d 192.168.0.0/16 -j RETURN
$IPT -t nat -A CLASH_TCP_RULE -p tcp --dport 22 -j RETURN
$IPT -t nat -A CLASH_TCP_RULE -p tcp --dport ${proxy_port} -j RETURN

# Redirect remaining TCP traffic
$IPT -t nat -A CLASH_TCP_RULE -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports ${proxy_port}

# DNS redirection
$IPT -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-port ${dns_port}

# Apply rules
$IPT -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -j CLASH_TCP_RULE
```

3. Save the script, make it executable, and run it at startup:

```bash
chmod +x clash-iptables.sh
sudo ./clash-iptables.sh
```

4. To persist the rules after reboot, use `iptables-persistent`:

```bash
sudo apt install iptables-persistent
iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

Alternatively, add the script to `/etc/rc.local` for execution at startup.
